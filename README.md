# THYME SAVER - A gardener's app.

## Description:
This project is intended to let users add plants to their profile and attach  instructions and information about individual plants. 
Thyme Saver uses Tefle.io as the API source for the plant information. Currently, not many plants have their full information filled out. As that
changes, Thyme Saver will be updated to reflect all of the options they provide to users.

## Installation 
Moving forward, the trefle.io token may be hidden. To get one, go to https://trefle.io and add that token to the header in the Application Controller or create your own .gitignore.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
