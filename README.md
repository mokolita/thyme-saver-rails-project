#THYME SAVER - A gardener's app.

#Motivation:
This project is intended to let users add plants to their profile and attach all sorts of instructions and information about individual plants. 
Thyme Saver uses Tefle.io as the API source for the plant information. Currently, not many plants have the full information filled out. As that
changes, Thyme Saver will be updated to reflect all of the options they provide to users.

#Documentation:
