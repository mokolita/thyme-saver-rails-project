add in the delete function for users.

When do I want users to add the status of the plant?
    -can I have a hidden field that sets it and they just click the submit button?

Where do helper methods go so that they are accessible in views?

trouble shoot why reminders aren't saving in the db from the form

        <%= #@user.show_instructions(p.id)%>
         <%= #render '/status', {:plantsuser => @plantsuser, :user => @user} %><br>


Why is the plant saving, but not being added to the user or plants_user????? Where did I go wrong associating those?
